Understanding both is important for anyone interested in technology.\n\nComputer hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer system. This includes:\n• Central Processing Unit (CPU) – the brain of the computer that processes instructions.\n• Random Access Memory (RAM) – temporary memory used to run programs quickly.\n• Hard Drive (HDD) or Solid-State Drive (SSD) – where files and programs are stored.\n• Motherboard – the main circuit board connecting all components.\n• Input Devices – like keyboards, mice, and scanners.\n• Output Devices – like monitors, printers, and speakers.\n\nSoftware, on the other hand, is a set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Software can be divided into two types:\n• System software – like operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) that manage hardware and allow other programs to run.\n• Application software – like Microsoft Word, web browsers, or games that let users perform specific tasks.\n\nWithout software, hardware is useless. And without hardware, software has nothing to run on. Both work together to make computers useful tools in business, education, and personal life.",

It controls the system’s memory, processes, devices, and software.\n\nSome of the most common operating systems include:\n• Microsoft Windows – widely used in homes and offices.\n• macOS – used on Apple’s desktop and laptop computers.\n• Linux – popular in servers and tech environments.\n• Android and iOS – used in mobile phones and tablets.\n\nThe OS performs several important functions:\n• Manages hardware resources, like the CPU, memory, and storage.\n• Provides a user interface, such as a desktop or command line.\n• Handles system security, including user permissions and virus protection.\n• Manages files, allowing users to create, delete, and organize data.\n• Runs applications, ensuring software can access needed resources.\n\nWithout an operating system, you would not be able to use your computer. It plays a central role in everything from browsing the internet to playing music or writing a report.",
